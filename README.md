# Riddlers

Code used to solve FiveThirtyEight weekly Riddlers, often using brute force methods.  Correctness may vary.

Past Riddles can be found [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/).

**_DISCLAIMER:_** My simulations are in R because I am an R user.  In the future, I may be simulating Riddlers in Python - or duplicating old Riddlers in Python - to sharpen my PySkills.
